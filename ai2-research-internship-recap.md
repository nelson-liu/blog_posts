I took Winter quarter 2017 off at UW to do a research internship at
the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)](http://allenai.org/),
where I worked on neural reading comprehension models for science exam question
answering.

I briefly wrote about my experiences on the AI2 blog, and you can read about
them
[here](https://medium.com/ai2-blog/ai2-research-internship-recap-2dfe561f1b8a#.z56r8ztmu).
Happy to answer questions about it as well.
