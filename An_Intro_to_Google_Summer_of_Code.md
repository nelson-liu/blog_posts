I'm participating in the Google Summer of Code, a program in which students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project over summer; I'll be working with the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) project to add several features to the `tree` module. You can read my proposal [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/%5BNelson-Liu%5D-GSoC-2016-Project-Proposal:-Addition-of-various-enhancements-to-the-tree-module-by-completing-stalled-pull-requests.).

The program also requires that I publish a blog about my project and work; as a result, this series of posts will recount progress, what I've been up to, and what I've learned. 

I'll be prepending all of the posts in this series with `GSoC Week #`, and they will be tagged under `gsoc`.

_You're awesome for reading this! Feel free to follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/nelson-liu)  if you want to track the progress of my Summer of Code project, or [subscribe to blog updates via email](http://eepurl.com/b8NcW5)._
